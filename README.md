# Comp6841 Project Introduction

## My Project: OverTheWire 
OverTheWire[^1] is a wargame platform that has capture-the-flag challenges suited to people who are new to cybersecurity. I chose this because I have no experience with wargames, and it seemed like a good way to be introduced to the world of ethical hacking and its related cybersecurity concepts.  

## Project aims  
My initial aims in this project were to attempt levels of the wargames Natas, Krypton, and Leviathan from OverTheWire, complete with technical write-ups for each level. The number of levels attempted was limited by the time allocated for this project, which was 30 hours. If I had time, I also considered attempting Narnia and Behemoth. 

In addition to this, I planned to produce a toolkit with these challenges and create a technical guide to attempting each type of challenge. 

When I first planned this project and discussed it with my tutor, they noted that I might be trying to do too much in the limited time frame. As such, I adjusted my aims to focus more on the Natas, Krypton, and Leviathan wargames, and completing the technical guide. 

As someone who is new to cybersecurity, I understand that it can be daunting and difficult to begin. This is why I wanted to create a guide to introduce someone to the world of ethical hacking, while also explaining the related security concepts. It targets an audience who has no experience with wargames and limited technical knowledge (like me when I started this project). 

While I would like to write an in-depth explanation for every technical concept we come across, I also acknowledge the time constraints of the project. Therefore, I aim to at least briefly explain the key concepts and then link resources for further reading. 

## Peak at Natas Level 0
#### Mindset: 
At this point, I would like to reiterate that I have absolutely no experience with Capture the Flag games. OverTheWire said that Natas teaches the basics of server-side web-security, and I didn’t know what that meant. 

#### Methodology:
I went to the website and entered the username and password provided. This was the webpage that I saw:

The page was seemingly blank. There was the text seen in the screenshot above and a link to We Chall, which is a ranking website for CTF challengers. This didn’t seem relevant to the challenge level, so I was stuck.

I tried clicking around the page to see if there were any clickable elements I missed, but didn’t find anything

At this point, I felt lost. I couldn’t even complete level 0, and there were no hints or information on this page or any other page on OverTheWire. I needed to attempt this challenge another way.
