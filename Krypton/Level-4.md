# Level 4

## Mindset
The hint explains how the Vigenère Cipher works.

Since this is a polyalphabetic cipher where a single letter can map to multiple letters, frequency analysis won’t work the same way as level 3. Since the key size is 6, every 6th letter will have the same operation applied to it. Therefore, you can do frequency analysis on every 6th letter like the 1st, 7th and 13th letters. 


## Methodology
I logged into Level 4 and found files similar to Level 3. I didn’t read the HINT file just yet.

The krypton5 file had this encrypted text: HCIKV RJOX

I checked whether CyberChef had the functionality to do frequency analysis for blocks of 6, but I couldn’t find anything. I tried doing the frequency analysis anyway and got this:
