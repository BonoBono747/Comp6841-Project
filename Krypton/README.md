# Introduction to Krypton

## Cryptography

In any software application, there is often a need for confidentiality. This can be web traffic such as passwords and communication, proprietary software encryption, and key exchange algorithms [^1].

Cryptography wargames will teach you the techniques behind encryption by getting you to decrypt encoded data. 

Some common ciphers and encryption techniques you may come across include: 
+	Substitution ciphers
+	Caesar Ciphers
+	Vigenère Ciphers
+	Block ciphering
+	Stream ciphering
+	MD5 Hash
+	RSA encryption

I will explain any encryption types we come across in the walkthrough; however, if you want more information now, use the following links:

## Software to get you started
[Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)  
All-purpose web application for analyzing, encoding and decoding data

[Quipquip](https://quipqiup.com/)  
Web application that attempts to automatically decipher substitution ciphers (including no-key Vigenère deciphering). Not always successful.
