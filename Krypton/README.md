## Cryptography

In any software applications, there is often the need for confidentiality. This can be web traffic such as passwords and communication, propriety software encryption and key exchange algorithms [^1].

Cryptography wargames will teach you the techniques behind encryption by getting you to decrypted encoded data. 

Some common ciphers and encryption techniques you may come across include: 
+	Substitution ciphers
+	Caesar Ciphers
+	Vigen√®re Ciphers
+	Block ciphering
+	Stream ciphering
+	MD5 Hash
+	RSA encryption
