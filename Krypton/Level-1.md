# Level 1

## Mindset

Level 0 mentioned that you need to ssh into krypton.labs.overthewire.org and gave us the password. In addition, it mentioned that the files for other levels can be found in /krypton/. 

/krypton/ looks like a directory I would navigate to within the ssh environment using bash commands so that seems like a good place to start.

The hint on overthewire.org for level 1 was that the string in krypton2 file was the password for level 2 and is encrypted in with a rotation cipher called ROT13. 

For more information on rotation ciphers, see the concepts section.


## Methodology


I connected to the site with: ```ssh krypton1@krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231```, using the password KRYPTONISGREAT from level 0.
