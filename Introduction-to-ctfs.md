# Re-evaluating my approach

## What are CTF challenges? 

Capture The Flag or CTF challenges are gamified security challenges that involve participants exploiting security vulnerabilities to retrieve a “flag” which is usually a string of text. These challenges provide an opportunity to grow your computing knowledge with hands-on experience and help keep hard skills up to date [^1] [^2] [^3]. 

There are different types of CTF formats, including Jeopardy-style questions with multiple categories, Attack-Defense style, which involves attacking and defending a network, and King of the Hill, where participants try to control a resource as long as possible.

I looked at a host of online resources to introduce to me CTFs which is included in references under CTF and security vulnerability resources. LINK THIS LTR

## Advice 
I summarized some of the best advice for CTF challenges that I found:
•	Hints: The short descriptions of challenges are often hints to how to solve them
•	Prioritize learning: Don’t be afraid to read write-ups of challenges. For a beginner, they’re a good place to start and even experienced challengers can learn new things from them.
•	Work together: It can be helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off and also makes CTF challengers more fun.
•	Use existing tools: There are a variety of tools out there that simplify what you need to solve challenges. Don’t over complicate things!
•	Avoid rabbit holes: If you get stuck on something, take break and come back to the problem later.
•	Write stuff down: Document your process of solving problems as they improve your overall mindset and may be useful in future challenges.

## Types of CTF challenges
There are different types of CTF challenges that you will encounter, and these are based on the different categories of vulnerabilities. Sometimes a challenge will require you to exploit multiple types of vulnerabilities to solve the challenge. I’ve listed them below with a short description. REFENCE

DO TABLE

There are other miscellaneous types of challenges and challenges that combine these types that are called exploitation/realistic/hybrid.
